# Xavigate Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Xavigate project! Xavigate is a modern full-stack project, which leverages the power of React for frontend development, a comprehensive design system, and a set of internal developer scripts for smooth development operations. This project is suited for developers or AI tools who are looking to interact with a modern, well-structured codebase.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
- /root
  - /src
    - /components
    - /containers
    - /services
    - /utils
    - index.js
  - /public
  - /design-system
  - /scripts
  - package.json
```

- `/src`: This directory contains all the React code for the project.
  - `/components`: This directory contains all the smaller, reusable React components.
  - `/containers`: This folder contains the larger React components, often composed of multiple smaller components.
  - `/services`: This directory contains pieces of code that make API calls or perform other business logic.
  - `/utils`: This directory contains utility functions and constants that are used across the project.
  
- `/public`: This directory contains static files like `index.html`, images, etc.

- `/design-system`: This directory contains everything related to the project's design system, including colors, typography, spacing, and component styles.

- `/scripts`: This directory contains internal developer scripts for tasks like bootstrapping the project, running tests, etc.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

# ðŸ§© FRONTEND README

# Frontend Folder README

Welcome to the `frontend/` directory of Xavigate! This directory houses a Vite-based React application that utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, Design Tokens for consistent theming, and a reusable component system to promote DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding principles.

## What does this folder do?

This folder contains all the necessary code and assets for the frontend of the Xavigate application. It includes all React components, Tailwind CSS configurations, design tokens, and other frontend utilities. All UI related tasks such as rendering views, handling user interactions, and managing frontend state are handled here.

## How to run it?

To run the frontend of Xavigate, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory from the project root:

   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Vite server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

## Useful Scripts

Here are some npm scripts that will come in handy while working with the frontend:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite server in development mode.

- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.

- `npm run serve`: Serves the production build locally.

- `npm run test`: Runs all the tests.

- `npm run lint`: Lints and formats the code.

Please remember that you need to be in the `frontend/` directory to run these scripts.

Happy Coding!

# ðŸ§© DESIGN-SYSTEM README

# Design System for Xavigate Project

## Overview

The `design-system/` folder is a vital part of our Xavigate React project. It can be understood as a library of reusable UI components, theme tokens, and shared types. 

A design system is a collection of standards for design and front-end code. It's a library of reusable, robust components and guidelines that are used to create a unique, cohesive, and scalable application. It enhances the consistency and efficiency of a product by reducing redundancy in the coding process, improving communication among teams, and speeding up the design process.

## Benefits of the Design System

1. **Reusability and Consistency**: The main advantage of using a design system is the reusable components. This leads to consistency across different parts of the application, enhancing the user experience. 

2. **Efficiency**: It speeds up the development process by providing a set of pre-built components that can be used across different parts of the application.

3. **Collaboration**: It helps in better communication and collaboration between designers, developers, and stakeholders.

## How to Use

To use any component from the `design-system/`, you first need to import it into your file. Each component is exported from its respective file, so you can import it directly. 

For example, if you want to use the `Button` component, you can use the following import statement:

```javascript
import { Button } from 'design-system';
```

After the component is imported, it can be used like any other React component:

```javascript
<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</Button>
```

## Adding New Components

When adding a new component to the design system, make sure it's reusable, well-documented and tested. It should be in its own file in the `components/` subdirectory, and should be exported from the `index.js` file.

## Theme Tokens

Theme tokens are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

To use theme tokens, import them from the design system and apply them in your styles:

```javascript
import { theme } from 'design-system';

const styles = {
  backgroundColor: theme.colors.primary,
};
```

## Shared Types

These are reusable type definitions that are used across different components. They help enforce the types of properties or variables, leading to less error-prone code.

To use shared types, import them from the design system:

```javascript
import { SharedTypes } from 'design-system';

const Component: React.FC<SharedTypes> = (props) => {
  // ...
};
```

By leveraging the `design-system/` folder, we can create a more consistent, efficient, and robust application. Happy coding!

# ðŸ§© SCRIPTS README

# Xavigate Project - `scripts/` Folder README

This README provides a brief overview of the `scripts/` folder for the Xavigate project. This folder contains a set of development automation scripts designed to improve efficiency and accuracy in tasks such as generating documentation, updating guides, and scaffolding files.

## Scripts Overview

1. **Documentation Generation (`docgen.js`)**: This script automates the generation of project documentation. It reads comments in the source code and generates comprehensive and up-to-date documentation. This helps maintain consistency and save time compared to manual documentation.

2. **Guide Update (`guideupdater.js`)**: This script helps to keep all the guides and README files across the project updated. It checks for changes in the source code that might affect the guides and prompts for updates where necessary. This ensures that our guides are always accurate and up-to-date.

3. **File Scaffolding (`scaffold.js`)**: This script automates the creation of new files or modules in the project. It sets up basic structure and boilerplate code to help developers kick-start their tasks. This helps to maintain a consistent structure and coding style across the project.

## How to Use the Scripts

These scripts are designed to be run from the command line. Below are basic instructions on how to use them:

1. **Documentation Generation**: Run `node docgen.js` from the root of the project. This will generate a new `docs/` folder with the updated documentation.

2. **Guide Update**: Run `node guideupdater.js` from the root of the project. This will scan all guides and READMEs for potential updates. If updates are found, it will prompt you to confirm and make the changes.

3. **File Scaffolding**: Run `node scaffold.js [filename]` from the root of the project. Replace `[filename]` with the name of the file or module you want to create. This will create a new file with the specified name and a basic structure.

## Why Use These Scripts

These scripts automate repetitive and error-prone tasks, allowing developers to focus on writing code. They help maintain consistency in code and documentation, making it easier for both new and existing developers to work on the project. They also help ensure that our documentation and guides are always accurate and up-to-date, improving the developer experience and reducing the potential for confusion or errors.
