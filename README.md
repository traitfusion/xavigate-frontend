# Xavigate Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Xavigate project! Xavigate is a modern full-stack project, which leverages the power of React for frontend development, a comprehensive design system, and a set of internal developer scripts for smooth development operations. This project is suited for developers or AI tools who are looking to interact with a modern, well-structured codebase.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
- /root
  - /src
    - /components
    - /containers
    - /services
    - /utils
    - index.js
  - /public
  - /design-system
  - /scripts
  - package.json
```

- `/src`: This directory contains all the React code for the project.
  - `/components`: This directory contains all the smaller, reusable React components.
  - `/containers`: This folder contains the larger React components, often composed of multiple smaller components.
  - `/services`: This directory contains pieces of code that make API calls or perform other business logic.
  - `/utils`: This directory contains utility functions and constants that are used across the project.
  
- `/public`: This directory contains static files like `index.html`, images, etc.

- `/design-system`: This directory contains everything related to the project's design system, including colors, typography, spacing, and component styles.

- `/scripts`: This directory contains internal developer scripts for tasks like bootstrapping the project, running tests, etc.

## Getting Started
