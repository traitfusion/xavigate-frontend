# Design System for Xavigate Project

## Overview

The `design-system/` folder is a vital part of our Xavigate React project. It can be understood as a library of reusable UI components, theme tokens, and shared types. 

A design system is a collection of standards for design and front-end code. It's a library of reusable, robust components and guidelines that are used to create a unique, cohesive, and scalable application. It enhances the consistency and efficiency of a product by reducing redundancy in the coding process, improving communication among teams, and speeding up the design process.

## Benefits of the Design System

1. **Reusability and Consistency**: The main advantage of using a design system is the reusable components. This leads to consistency across different parts of the application, enhancing the user experience. 

2. **Efficiency**: It speeds up the development process by providing a set of pre-built components that can be used across different parts of the application.

3. **Collaboration**: It helps in better communication and collaboration between designers, developers, and stakeholders.

## How to Use

To use any component from the `design-system/`, you first need to import it into your file. Each component is exported from its respective file, so you can import it directly. 

For example, if you want to use the `Button` component, you can use the following import statement:

```javascript
import { Button } from 'design-system';
```

After the component is imported, it can be used like any other React component:

```javascript
<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</Button>
```

## Adding New Components

When adding a new component to the design system, make sure it's reusable, well-documented and tested. It should be in its own file in the `components/` subdirectory, and should be exported from the `index.js` file.

## Theme Tokens

Theme tokens are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

To use theme tokens, import them from the design system and apply them in your styles:

```javascript
import { theme } from 'design-system';

const styles = {
  backgroundColor: theme.colors.primary,
};
```

## Shared Types

These are reusable type definitions that are used across different components. They help enforce the types of properties or variables, leading to less error-prone code.

To use shared types, import them from the design system:

```javascript
import { SharedTypes } from 'design-system';

const Component: React.FC<SharedTypes> = (props) => {
  // ...
};
```

By leveraging the `design-system/` folder, we can create a more consistent, efficient, and robust application. Happy coding!
